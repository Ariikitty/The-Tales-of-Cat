 ## Installing on Mac
 The steps for installing on the mac is slightly more complicated due to the app being compiled on a Windows PC.

 2. Extract the files from the rar file
 3. Open Terminal
 4. Enter "cd <Path of file>/CollegeGame.app/Contents/MacOS" into Terminal
 5. Enter "chmod +x CollegeGame" into Terminal
 6. Close Terminal and run CollegeGame
